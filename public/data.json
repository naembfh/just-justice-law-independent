        "description": "Unfortunately, many people sign them without a full understanding of their terms.  You're always better off negotiating an agreement on the front end, rather than waiting for something to go wrong.  That's why we encourage all individuals to schedule a comprehensive review session before they sign anything.  We'll make sure you understand every last word of your agreement, and give you the tools you need to make important changes.  If you've already signed a contract and need help enforcing it - or getting out of it - we can help with that too. ",
